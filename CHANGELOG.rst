* Added 16MB doc limit TODO to README.md
* Added session based DB to ROS bag support
* Fix for cursor returning all objects view and added session based search
* Added default stabilise_time to run_scenario.launch
* Removed redundant recursive function in place of generator
* Save python dict not serialised class object and deprecate getitem api
* Completed TODOs and updated SubscriberTree doc

* Added session property and fixed ros_time
* Unification of API and added load overload for MongoStorage connections
* Updated docs for iterators
* Added TopicStore typed API and session IDs
* Clear up documentation
* Defined storage API for unification
* Removed pointless assert
* Changed the tests files to support pytest
  Run pytest tests/ -v from project root
* Use of all parsers is now implicit the type coercion is now automatically handled
* Force type conversion for all TopicStore objects and serialisation version
* Added warning for conversion from ROS bag to fs/db
* Added warning for conversion from ROS bag to fs/db
* Added ability to convert between filesystem<->database and convert either to ROS bags using unified API
* Added reverse parser to go from MongoDB types (i.e unicode->str) to python types
* Added reverse mongodb parser for python 2.7 support
* Database now fully supported as a storage method and API is unified
* Major API improvements for mongo db interface
* Added default MongoDB server (start_database.launch) to safely bring up a dockerised mongo db server instance.
  Will not conflict with any current system requirements or legacy MongoDB versions.
* Added conversion from .topic_store files to mongodb databases
* Added ROSBag conversions for new interface
* Updated README.md to reflect repo changes
* Added MongoDB loading usage to README.md
* Added basic MongoDB compatibility
* Added support for genpy.Time and genpy.Duration
* Major scenario file upgrades ready for database support
* By default assign BSON.ObjectIDs to all TopicStore items
* Added conversion utility to ROSBags
* Added examples
* Implemented single storage container for filesystem for future ROS bag support and easier loading
* Added type coercion tests
* Added float epoch time functions
* Cleaner type cohesion API
  parser = DefaultTypeParser()
  parse_this = [{"0": 0}, {"1": 1}]
  parsed = parser(parse_this)
* Updated README.md to better document launch
* Added roadmap
* Added some scenario documentation
* Implemented ActionLib interface for collecting data
  Test with `rosrun actionlib axclient.py '''/collect_data'''`
